# Data Layout Benchmarks

This repository contains all code for the [Why You Shouldn't Forget to Optimize the Data Layout](https://cedardb.com/blog/optimizing_data_layouts/) blogpost.

To build and execute all benchmarks, simply run

```
sh runBenchmark.sh
```

The benchmark results in the paper were executed on the performance cores with taskset -c 0-11.
